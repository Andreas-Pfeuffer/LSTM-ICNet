# LSTM-ICNet

This repo provides the tensorflow implementation of papers "[Semantic Segmentation of Video Sequences with Convolutional LSTMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01058.pdf)," and "[Separable Convolutional LSTMs for Faster Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06876.pdf)" by Andreas Pfeuffer, et. al.
  
** Note: The code will be released at the end of this year. Please have a little patience! **
